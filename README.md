# RAG-Product-Recommendation
Applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and OpenAI API to Create Product Recommendations

To enhance our product recommendation system at ShopSmart!
The customer feedback clearly indicates the need for more accurate and contextually relevant product suggestions.

Your first step will be to preprocess the existing customer reviews using advanced text preprocessing techniques. Then, you'll vectorize this preprocessed text data using TF-IDF and build a FAISS index for efficient similarity searches. Afterward, you'll develop a function to retrieve similar products using the FAISS index and generate comprehensive product descriptions from the reviews with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. You'll also integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance the accuracy of these descriptions.Finally, you will evaluate the quality of the generated product descriptions using BLEU and ROUGE scores. This evaluation will ensure that our recommendations are not only accurate but also highly relevant to our customers' queries.
